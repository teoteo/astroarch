# ‚ö†Ô∏è BE SURE TO READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION AT LEAST BEFORE STARTING ASTROARCH ‚ö†Ô∏è
**AstroArch doesn't support yet HDMI, it means it works only via VNC and if you plug a monitor, you won't see the desktop although the system may be functional.**

**After acknowledging this fact, enjoy the rest of the read ü§ì**

<br />
<br />
<br />


# Passwords
To save you some time, here the default password you will need for AstroArch:
 - the user password for `astronaut` (which is the user used to login or for ssh) is `astro`
 - the password for the `AstroArch` WiFi hotspot is `astronomy`

# Use only the astro packages mantained for AstroArch on PC and mini PC
If you have an x64 distro based on ArchLinux on your PC and you just want to access the packages I mantain (kstas, phd2, stellarsolver, indi, indi libs and drivers) add my repo to your pacman.conf file (under /etc/pacman.conf) **before** the [core] section, the repo looks like the following
```
[astromatto]
SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
Server = http://astroarch.astromatto.com:9000/$arch
```

# Download
Please use this link to download the latest astroarch gzipped img file => https://drive.google.com/file/d/16PIVjSv3SlXbfLGU75egr8toXrrJN-yc/view

# Flash the img to an SD
If you prefer a GUI, use [balenaHetcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) otherwise you can use the unix `dd` to flash it, and if you are using `dd` I think
there is nothing I shall explain to you :)

# Useful commands
The followings are some useful commands that you can run from the terminal so you don't have to deal with complicated stuff by yourself if you don't want to:
 - `update-astroarch` => this command will update system packages (including kstars, indi, etc. if there are new versions) and will pull any fix for astroarch itself, additionally will update the astroarch configuration that may bring in more commands etc.
 - `astro-rollback-indi` => rollback automatically indi to the previous version
 - `astro-rollback-kstars` => rollback automatically indi to the previous version
 - `astro-rollback-full` => rollback automatically indi and kstars to the previous version

# First boot
After you burned the .img file to your SD, you _should_ be able to reach astroarch via VNC, however if you don't see the desktop or you can't connect to it
this likely means that unfortunately your raspberry pi rev cannot boot the image. In this case please plug a monitor and report here the output!
Once you are logged in the first thing you should do is update the system, open the terminal and type `update-astroarch` command

# Connecting via browser (noVNC)
By default `AstroArch` will start a hostpot called `AstroArch`, to connect to that WiFi network use the password `astronomy`

noVNC is installed and it will start by default, if your pi is wired to your network you can connect to it with the follwing methods:
- **http://astroarch.local:8080/vnc.html**
- if the previous method doesn't work, find your raspberry pi IP, connect to it through your browser typing `http://RASPBERRY_IP:8080/vnc.html`
 
otherwise, if you want to connect to its hotspot, find the WiFi network `AstroArch` (the pass is `astronomy`) and type in your browser `http://10.42.0.1:8080/vnc.html`

Welcome to astro arch!

# Adding swap
By default astroarch don't have swap, for prevent issues about memory space you can add a swap file and enable it, we will set swappiness to 10 don't use swap file if RAM space is ok.
In this example we make a 2GB swapfile 
```
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile 
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
sudo echo "vm.swappiness = 10" | sudo tee -a  /etc/sysctl.d/99-swappiness.conf
```

Check swappiness
```
$ cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
10
```
Check if Swap is enabled
```
free -h
```
Output should be something like this on Swap row :
```
$ free -h
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           3.7Gi       1.4Gi       1.1Gi        88Mi       1.3Gi       2.3Gi
Swap:          2.0Gi          0B       2.0Gi
```
Make permanent swapfile on system
```
$ sudo echo "/swapfile   none    swap    sw              0       0" | sudo tee -a  /etc/fstab
```


# Boot from external disk
If you want to use a USB or a SDD to boot AstroArch, follow the next steps (maybe one day I will ship 2 different images for SD/USB+SDD):
1) flash the image to the USB/HDD/SDD the same way you would flash to a SD card
2) insert your disk into your PC and you should see 2 partitions (not sure on Windows you can see the root partition which is an ext4)
3) in the smallest one EDIT the file cmdline.txt and replace mmcblk0p2 with sda2
4) in the biggest partition open the file /etc/fstab and replace mcblk0p1with sda1 and mmcblk0p2 with sda2
5) remove your disk from your PC and plug into the raspberry, boot it up
6) edit the file `/etc/systemd/system/resize_once.service` - change the line 7 from /dev/mmcblk0 to /dev/sda
7) On the line ExecStop there is a \p, drop the p and save the file
8) run in the terminal `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
9) run in the terminal `sudo systemctl start resize_once`

The partition is extended now and you can boot from your external device

# How to add a RTC
Adding a RTC to AstroArch is easy from version 1.6.
First, wire your RTC to your pi, open a terminal and type `sudo i2cdetect -y 1` you should see a similar table, take note of the number for the next steps
![i2cdetect](https://github.com/devDucks/astroarch/assets/4163222/147f90ed-6f56-43ab-900b-0ad0c44f919c)

Now find the line `dtoverlay=i2c-rtc` in `/boot/config.txt` and modify it by adding a comma and the name of your RTC device, in my case for the ds3231 will be `dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds3231`

Reboot your Raspberry PI and if you type again `sudo i2cdetect -y 1` you should now see a `UU` instead of the number, this means the kernel module for your RTC has been loaded correctly.

That's all you need! We just enabled automatic modules to setup the system time from the RTC if it's present! No more steps are required!

Reboot your PI and you should have the time automatically synchronized when it starts!

If you want to remove the RTC sync just drop `,xxxx` from `/boot/config.txt` at line `dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,xxxx`

# My time is not syncing from the network, what should I do?
Some users have been reporting that the system time is not syncing whit the network, I am not sure where this problem comes from but it seems related to `timesyncd` (the utility used to sync network time) and a mobile internet network.

Should you have this problem, please following the next steps
```shell
sudo systemctl disable --now systemd-timesyncd
sudo pacman -S ntp
sudo systemctl enable --now ntpd
```
Follow this [guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Network_Time_Protocol_daemon) at section 2.1 to setup the ntp servers and your clock should star tto sync again after a reboot

# Reporting issues
AstroArch is actually in a stable state, however, should you find any issue please report them here https://github.com/MattBlack85/astroarch/issues this will help me tracking them and ship a fix for them
